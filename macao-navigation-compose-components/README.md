## Component Toolkit
Component-toolkit is a state management library rather than a component ui library. A Component is nothing else than a State Holder class to help with state hoisting.
In the context of this library, Components are state holders that form a tree, in this tree,
Components can interact with each other directly or indirectly.
In a direct manner, a parent component will create or hoist children components so it knows the children types and functionality.
In an indirect way, a Component can connect to another Component in the tree that is not necesarelly its children. Using Component deep linking, any Component in the tree can connect to another Component and send requests and receive results back.

#### <a id="simple-component"></a>Simple Component
To create a component all you need to do is extend the Component class and provide an implementation
for the Composable content.

```kotlin
  @Composable 
  fun Content() {
  }
```
A simple Component class will look like this.

```kotlin
class SimpleComponent(
    val screenName: String,
    val onResult: (result: Boolean) -> Unit
) : Component() {

    override fun onAttach() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onAttach()")
    }
   
    override fun onActive() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onActive()")
    }

    override fun onInactive() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onInactive()")
    }

    override fun onDetach() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onDetach()")
    }

    @Composable
    override fun Content(modifier: Modifier) {
        println("${instanceId()}::Composing()")
        // To handle back press events.
        BackPressHandler()
        Column (
            modifier = modifier.fillMaxSize()
                .background(bgColor)
                .verticalScroll(rememberScrollState()),
            horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
        ) {
            Text(text = screenName)
            Button(
                modifier = Modifier.padding(vertical = 40.dp),
                onClick = { onResult(true) }
            ) { 
                Text(text = "Click me") 
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### <a id="state-component"></a>State Component
A simple component like the one in the previous section offers a lot of possibilities but with freedom comes responsibility and we tend to get creative and invent so many things that are fine 
for us but hard to understand for others. So, to help with putting a little bit of order, the library has a couple of built-in components that follow the MVVM pattern which is really popular. All
predefined components are design using the MVVM and the library encourages other developers creating components to do the same.

Talking about extending functionality, the only Component that can be inherited from, is the abstract `Component` class. The rest of the components, extend functionality by using a parametrized 
`ViewModel` that gets passed in the component constructor. Actually not, is a factory of this `ViewModel` what gets passed to the Component constructor. The library discourage inheritance and 
encourage composition, you should to write your custom components the same way. No inheritance other than the `Component class`.

Bellow snippet shows a custom ViewModel class `DemoViewModel` and its corresponding factory.

```kotlin

// The ViewModel
class DemoViewModel(
    private val component: StateComponent<DemoViewModel>,
    private val viewModelDependencies: ViewModelDependencies // Any dependency you viewmodel depends on
) : ComponentViewModel() {

    val name = "DemoViewModel"
   
    override fun onAttach() { 
        println("${instanceId()}::onAttach()")
        ...
    }

    override fun onActive() {
        println("My bound Component ID = ${component.instanceId()}")
        viewModelDependency.getX()
        ...
    }

    override fun onInactive() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onInactive()")
    }

    override fun onDetach() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onDetach()")
    }
}

// The corresponding factory for the ViewModel
class DemoViewModelFactory(
    private val viewModelDependencies: ViewModelDependencies, // Prefereably inject this using a DI library
) : ComponentViewModelFactory<DemoViewModel> {

    override fun create(component: StateComponent<DemoViewModel>): DemoViewModel {
        return DemoViewModel(component, viewModelDependencies)
    }
}
```

And bellow snippet shows how to create the StateComponent instance parameterized to this DemoViewModel class.

```kotlin
// You can have a reference to a composable lambda that is an extention of StateComponent<DemoViewModel> in another file.
// file: DemoComponentView.kt

val DemoComponentView: @Composable StateComponent<DemoViewModel>.(
        modifier: Modifier,
        demoViewModel: DemoViewModel
    ) -> Unit = { modifier, demoViewModel ->

        BackPressHandler() // If interesting in handling back press events
        Text("My Component ID: ${instanceId()}")
    }

// file: DemoComponentTest.kt

fun test1() {
    viewModelDependencies = ViewModelDependencies()

    val component1 = StateComponent<DemoViewModel>(
        viewModelFactory = DemoViewModelFactory(viewModelDependencies),
        content = DemoComponentView
    )
    
    component1.dispatchStart()
}
```

Or define the composable function in the call-site as a trailing lambda

```kotlin
fun test2() {
    viewModelDependencies = ViewModelDependencies()

    val component2 = StateComponent<DemoViewModel>(
        viewModelFactory = DemoViewModelFactory(viewModelDependencies)
    ) { modifier: Modifier, demoViewModel: DemoViewModel ->

        BackPressHandler() // If interesting in handling back press events
        Text("This Composable is an extension function of StateComponent<DemoViewModel>")
        Text("My Component ID: ${instanceId()}")
        Text("My componentViewModel = ${demoViewModel.name}")
    }

    component2.dispatchStart()
}
```

Above API design gives a developer enough freedom to define whatever ViewModel class and whatever Composable function to render that specific ViewModel type.

#### <a id="navigation-component"></a>Navigation Component
Simple components or StateComponents are basically leaf nodes in the Component tree. They are made just for that, rendering a given state, but that is it.

However, to make a full App we will need more sophisticated components. Components that allow to do things like navigation between components, data passing between components and things of this nature. 
A fundamental aspect of a node in a tree is to have children, so we need components that can hoist children components. The toolkit defines an interface just for that, `ComponentWithChildren`.

`ComponentWithChildren` interface is the base of `ComponentWithBackStack` and `NavigationComponent` interfaces. Any Component interested in providing navigation should implement one of these interfaces.
The `ComponentWithBackStack` contains a `navigator: Navigator` class that one can use to navigate between children components in a stack manner. See example bellow.

```kotlin
val childComponent = StateComponent<CustomStateViewModel>()

val stackComponent = StackComponent<StackViewModel>(
    viewModelFactory = StackViewModelFactory(),
        content = StackComponentDefaults.DefaultStackComponentView
    )

stackComponent.navigator.push(childComponent)
stackComponent.navigator.pop()
```

The toolkik provides the basic navigation components to build an App and provides an easy API to create any custom navigation component. The next code snippet shows how to instantiate a BottomNavigationComponent for instance.

```kotlin
fun testBottomNavigationComponentCreation() {

    val bottomNavigationStyle = BottomNavigationStyle(
        barSize = 56.dp,
        showLabel = true,
        bgColor = Color.Cyan,
        unselectedColor = Color.LightGray,
        selectedColor = Color.Gray,
        textSize = 14.dp
    )

   val bottomNavigationPresenterDefault = BottomNavigationComponentDefaults.createBottomNavigationStatePresenter(
       bottomNavigationStyle = bottomNavigationStyle
   )

    val bottomNavigationComponent = BottomNavigationComponent(
            viewModelFactory = BottomNavigationDemoViewModelFactory(
                bottomNavigationStatePresenter = bottomNavigationPresenterDefault
            ),
            content = BottomNavigationComponentDefaults.BottomNavigationComponentView
        )
        
    bottomNavigationComponent.dispatchStart()

}
```

Above code snippet will produce a component similar to the image bellow.

<image src="https://github.com/pablichjenkov/component-toolkit/assets/5303301/d331f0a9-1241-484a-82bf-517f3fdd3168" width=220 />

Previous code snippet uses `BottomNavigationComponentDefaults.BottomNavigationComponentView` which is a Composable function that renders classes of `BottomNavigationComponentViewModel` type. But if you want a custom rendering of your own `CustomBottomNavigationViewModel`, you just need to implement your own class that extends `BottomNavigationComponentViewModel` and pass it to the `BottomNavigationComponent`.

`A custom BottomNavigation Composable would look like this:`

```kotlin
val CustomBottomNavigationView: @Composable BottomNavigationComponent<CustomBottomNavigationViewModel>.(
        modifier: Modifier,
        childComponent: Component // Currently selected component child in the BottomNavigation
    ) -> Unit = { modifier, childComponent ->

        NavigationBottom(
            modifier = modifier,
            bottomNavigationStatePresenter = componentViewModel.bottomNavigationStatePresenter
        ) {

           val navItems by bottomNavigationStatePresenter.navItemsState

           Column {
              Text("My Custom rendering of BottomNavigationCustomViewModel")
           Button(
              onClick = { bottomNavigationStatePresenter.onClickMe() }
           ) {
              Text("Click Me")
           }
              childComponent.Content(Modifier)
           }
        }
    }

```

The BottomNavigationComponentViewModel needs a base BottomNavigationStatePresenter. Make your CustomBottomNavigationStatePresenter extend BottomNavigationStatePresenter and provide your implementation to your CustomBottomNavigationViewModel.

`A custom BottomNavigationStatePresenter would look like this:`

```kotlin

data class CustomBottomNavigationStyle(
    val barSize: Dp = 56.dp,
    val showLabel: Boolean = true,
    val bgColor: Color = Color.Cyan,
    val unselectedColor: Color = Color.LightGray,
    val selectedColor: Color = Color.Gray,
    val textSize: Dp = 14.dp
)

class CustomBottomNavigationStatePresenter(
    dispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher,
    override val bottomNavigationStyle: BottomNavigationStyle = CustomBottomNavigationStyle(),
    navItemList: List<BottomNavigationNavItem> = emptyList()
) : BottomNavigationStatePresenter {

    // Override the abstract functions
    override fun navItemClick(navbarItem: BottomNavigationNavItem) {
        ...
    }

    ...

    // A custom function
    fun blinkSelectedTabWhenComponentStart() {
        ...
    }

    // A callback from composable
    fun onClickMe() {
        ...
    }
}
```

`A custom BottomNavigationComponentViewModel ViewModel would look like this:`

```kotlin
class CustomBottomNavigationViewModel(
    bottomNavigationComponent: BottomNavigationComponent<CustomBottomNavigationViewModel>,
    override val bottomNavigationStatePresenter: CustomBottomNavigationStatePresenter,
    private val httpClient: HttpClient()
) : BottomNavigationComponentViewModel(bottomNavigationComponent) {

    private val coroutineScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main)

    override fun onAttach() {
       println("${instanceId()}::onAttach()")
       coroutineScope.launch {
          val navBarItems = fetchNavBarItems()
          val selectedIndex = 0
          bottomNavigationComponent.setNavItems(navBarItems, selectedIndex)
       }
    }
   
    override fun onActive() {
        bottomNavigationStatePresenter.blinkSelectedTabWhenComponentStart()
    }

    override fun onInactive() {
    }

    override fun onDetach() {
    }

    private suspend fun fetchNavBarItems(): MutableList<NavItem> {
        return httpClient.fetchRemoteNavItems()
    }

}
```

There are many other navigation Components such as `DrawerComponent`, `PagerComponent`, `PanelComponent`, `TopBarComponent`, `StackComponent` and a special type of Component named `AdaptiveSizeComponent` which takes 3 NavigationComponents as children, each one to be used depending on the screen size when it varies.
You can also create your own navigator by implementing the NavigationComponent interface. Check the code in NavBarComponent for instance, to have some guidance on how to do so.

#### <a id="platform-renderers"></a>Platform Renderes
You may have noticed in previous code samples the use of `component.dispatchStart()` function. This function basically tells the component that the underlying platform lifecycle gave the signal to start. In the case of Android it is an Activity in the case of iOS a UiViewController, the web uses the window browser lifecycle and desktop the desktop window lifecycle too. In reality, you don't need to deal with platform's lifecycle and having to call `component.dispatchStart()` or `component.dispatchStop()`. Neither you need to call `Component::Content(Modifier)` in each platform to render the component content, the toolkit has that functionality already built in. The toolkit provides a Component renderer Composable function in each platform, that just receive the root component and takes care of the rest. See bellow code snippets for more details.

```kotlin
// Android
@Composable
fun AndroidComponentRender(rootComponent: Component)

// iOS
@Composable
fun IosComponentRender(rootComponent: Component)

// Desktop
@Composable
fun DesktopComponentRender(
    rootComponent: Component,
    windowState: WindowState
)

// JS
@Composable
fun BrowserComponentRender(rootComponent: Component)
```
This is a snippet on Android, see the toolkit Demo App for the other platforms.
```kotlin
class DrawerActivity : ComponentActivity() {

    private val drawerComponent = DrawerComponent(
        viewModelFactory = DrawerDemoViewModelFactory(
            DrawerComponentDefaults.createDrawerStatePresenter()
        ),
        content = DrawerComponentDefaults.DrawerComponentView
    )

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            MaterialTheme {
                AndroidComponentRender(rootComponent = drawerComponent)
            }
        }
    }

    override fun onConfigurationChanged(newConfig: Configuration) {
        super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig)
        // Checks the orientation of the screen
        if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {
            Toast.makeText(this, "landscape", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        } else if (newConfig.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT) {
            Toast.makeText(this, "portrait", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        }
    }

}
```

You can also embed the root component in an existing Composable you are already using. You will have to figure out a way to get the root component and ComponentRender composable function dependencies.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyExistingScreen() {

    ...

    // Example 
    val diContainer = DiContainerCompositionLocal.current
    val viewModelDependencies = diContainer.viewModelDependencies

    val rootComponent = remember(viewModelDependencies) {
        StateComponent<DemoViewModel>(
            viewModelFactory = DemoViewModelFactory(viewModelDependencies),
            content = DemoComponentView
        )
    }

    // Here as an example in iOS
    IosComponentRender(rootComponent)

    ...

}
```

#### <a id="components-deep-linking"></a>Components Deep Linking
A parent Component can activate/deactivate or show/hide a direct child Component. It does so by calling dispatchStart()/dispatchStop() on the respective child. But sometimes in an App, a user needs to go to another screen that is not a direct child of the current screen. Let's say there is a banner in the Feed screen that takes users to the Setting screen to see their most recent credit score changes.
The toolkit support this type of navigation by using deep links. Each Component has a property named `uriFragment` that represents a path in the deep link uri. The App developer most know the path to the Component to be able to navigate to it.

```kotlin
val rootComponent = LocalRootComponentProvider.current

Button(
    modifier = Modifier.padding(vertical = 40.dp),
    onClick = {
       DefaultDeepLinkManager().navigateToDeepLink(
          rootComponent,
          DeepLinkMsg(
             /**
              * The path is a list of all uriFragment between the component pass as rootComponent
              * and the selected component. All uriFragments have to match in order to activate
              * the full path of components up to the very last one.
              * Eg: _navigator_adaptive -> * -> Settings -> Page 3
              * In this example, `*` is used to skip the uriFragment comparison. You can create
              * your custom skippers or uri rules, just override bellow function in your component.
              * fun getChildForNextUriFragment(nextUriFragment: String): Component? { ... }
              * */
             path = listOf("_navigator_adaptive", "*", "Settings", "Page 3"),
             resultListener = { result  ->
                println("$screenName deeplink result: $result")
                if (result is DeepLinkResult.Success) {
                   subscribeToSimpleResponseComponent(
                      result.componentOrNull<SimpleResponseComponent>()
                   )
                }
             }
          )
       )
    }
) {
    Text(text = "Go To Settings/Page 3")
}
```
Lets decode above snippet:
1. First it grabs the `rootComponent` from a CompositionLocal.
2. Create a `DeepLinkMsg` specifying the `path` and a `resultListener` to receive the result of the deep link navigation as well as the navigated to Component.
   `path = listOf("_navigator_adaptive", "*", "Settings", "Page 3")` indicates that the first Component which `uriFragmet = _navigator_adaptive`, then `*` means that there is a NavigationComponent in the deep link route that will accept any uri path as name. Then it goes through the `Settings` TopBarComponent and then finally to `Page 3` SimpleResponseComponent.
3. Call Component::navigateToDeepLink(DeepLinkMsg) function to start the navigation. The algorithm will traverse the Component tree matching the uri path against the Components uriFragment property. As it traverse the tree it activates the Components that match each uri path. If a full uri match succeed, then a `DeepLinkResult.Success` is returned and as a result of traversing the tree, the Component represented by the last uri path will be the one active.
   If no child Component is found to match a specific uri path at a specific tree level, then a `DeepLinkResult.Error` will be returned.
4. Once the component has been navigated to, the DeepLinkResult gives a reference to it. Use DeepLinkResult::componentOrNull to cast it to your type, see code below:
    ```kotlin
       resultListener = { result  ->
           when (result) {
               is DeepLinkResult.Success -> {
                   val myCustomComponent = result.componentOrNull<MyCustomComponent>() // get the reference to the deep linked component
                   coroutineScope.launch {
                       myCustomComponent.resultSharedFlow.collect { // start receiving events from the deep linked component
                           println("Received myCustomComponent response = $it")
                       }
                   }
               }
               is DeepLinkResult.Error -> {
                   println("Deep link navigation error: $it")
               }
           }           
       }
    ```

#### <a id="component-lifecycle"></a>Component Lifecycle
Components and ViewModels conform to specific application lifecycles, `ComponentLifecycle` and `ComponentViewModelLifecycle` respectively. 

```kotlin
class SimpleComponent(
    val screenName: String,
    val bgColor: Color,
    val onMessage: (Msg) -> Unit
) : Component() {

    override fun onAttach() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onAttach()")
    }

    override fun onActive() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onActive()")
    }

    override fun onInactive() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onInactive()")
    }

    override fun onDetach() {
        println("${instanceId()}::onDetach()")
    }

    ...
}
```

These lifecycle classes are pretty similar to lifecycles in Android but with an important difference. The lifecycle is not just controlled by the underliying Activity, UiViewController or Window. It is also related to the component vissibility in its parent component. In other words, the parent component controll the lifecycle of its children depending if they are vissible or not.
The components lifecycle is determine by the platform lifecycle plus vissibility in the parent. 
In regards to platform lifecycle, the library commonize the platforms in the following manner:

`Android::onActive()` = `iOS::UIApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification` = `!(Desktop/Browser)::Window::minimized`

`Android::onInactive()` = `iOS::UIApplication.didEnterBackgroundNotification` = `(Desktop/Browser)::Window::minimized`

To propagate platforms events into compose the library uses a **DefaultAppLifecycleDispatcher**. Check that class usage to see how it works. The same technique can be applied for communication between any platform API and compose so it is worthy to check how this class work.

#### <a id="components-ext"></a>Component Extensions
The toolkit provides some nice extensions to match some extension functions popular in Android.

##### repeatOnLifecycle
```kotlin
suspend fun Component.repeatOnLifecycle(
    block: suspend CoroutineScope.() -> Unit
)
```

##### collectAsStateWithLifecycle
```kotlin
@Composable
fun <T> Flow<T>.collectAsStateWithLifecycle(
    initialValue: T,
    component: Component,
    context: CoroutineContext = EmptyCoroutineContext
): State<T>
```

```kotlin
@Composable
fun <T> StateFlow<T>.collectAsStateWithLifecycle(
    component: Component,
    context: CoroutineContext = EmptyCoroutineContext
): State<T>
```

##### MVVM architecture
In adition to above extension functions, the toolkit provides a `abstract ComponentViewModel` class for those familiar with MVVM architecture. To use this specialized ViewModel, you have to use the `StateComponent<VM : ComponentViewModel>` class. See the StateComponent section above [State Component](#state-component).
